# Overview

The idea behind building this app was to help me understand the basics of `React Native` by building a journal app. The app is quite simple but I was able to acomplish my goals by buidling it. I was able to learn how to use the different react modules, how create an app using components and how to use expo to launch my app and test it.

Bellow is a link for the app demonstration:

# Development Environment

For the journal app I used VS code as my editior and JavaScript as the main programming lanaguage.

You need to have the following tools intaled to launch this app:
- `Node.js`
- Install this package to save journal entries `npm install @react-native-async-storage/async-storage`
- `Expo` to launch your app


# Useful Websites

Here is list of website that I used to get started on this project.
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en)
* [Expo Go or Expo developer](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/start-developing/)
* [React Native tutorial](https://reactnative.dev/docs/getting-started)

# Future Work

The app could use more functionalities. In the furture I would like to add the following features:
* Use location when saving journal entries.
* Set reminders to write in your journal
* Be able to attach a picture or video
